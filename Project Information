11/11 Blake:
Put the following into the body of your sitemap for this project, edit it as you want to make styling consistent:

<li><a href="project/home.php">Project</a>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="project/home.php">Home page</a></li>
            <li> Project Files 
                 <ul>
                     <li><a href="css/project.css">CSS for the project</a></li>
                 </ul>
            </li>
    </ol> 
</li>  

With this you'll have to 
  -make a folder called project in your cs008 folder
  -make a css file called project.css and put it in the css folder
  -create a home.php file in project/
I made base files on here for these that we can use to add our edits to.
