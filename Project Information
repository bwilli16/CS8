11/11 Blake:
Put the following into the body of your sitemap for this project, edit it as you want to make styling consistent:

<a href="project/home.php">Project</a>
<ol>
    <li><a href="project/home.php">Home page</a></li>
    <li> Project Files 
        <ul>
            <li><a href="css/project.css">CSS for the project</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

With this you'll have to 
  -make a folder called project in your cs008 folder
  -make a css file called project.css and put it in the css folder
  -create a home.php file in project/
I made base files on here for these that we can use to add our edits to.
