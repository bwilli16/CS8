                These can be expensive to get from the grocery store, but they will help to make your food taste good.
                Try getting them fresh from a farmer's market, or buy some basil and rosemary plants/seeds and grow your own!

                These include bread, rice, pasta, potatoes, and other food rich in simple carbohydrates. While this food group gets
                a bad rap, starches are incredibly versatile (you can use them to make practically anything and will keep for a long time.

                Yogurt contains lots of probiotics and can be eaten by itself as a snack, with granola as a healthy breakfast, or as an ingredient
                in several baking recipes. It comes in a lot of varieties and flavors, and there is even Greek yogurt for people who are lactose
                or gluten intolerant!

                It should go without saying, but salt is one of the most important ingredients you can have in your pantry. It adds flavor to your
                favorite foods and is used in many baking recipes to slow down chemical reactions in the oven and balance out the flavors of the 
                sweet ingredients.

        <figcaption> <b>Cheese</b> <br>
                For many people, this dairy staple is something they can't go without. Because cheese comes in so many forms and types, it can be used
                to make practically anything. The key is to figure out what types of cheese you like on or in different types of foods. At the very least,
                you should keep some shredded cheese, sliced cheese, cream cheese, and some cheese to put on/in your pasta.

        <figcaption> <b>Ground meat</b> <br>
            For people who eat meat, this is usually the cheapest option to buy at the store. You can use it to make a variety of dishes (tacos, chili, pasta,
            etc.) and can get it in many types (beef, poultry, turkey, etc.) to switch up the flavor and fat content. It also freezes well, so you don't have to
            use it all at once!

        <figcaption> <b>Oils</b><br>
                Cooking oils are a good source of fat for the body and help to make food taste good. The two basic kinds you'll need are olive oil (for low heat
                meals like pasta) and canola oil (for high heat cooking, frying, and baking).

        <figcaption> <b>Frozen fruits and vegetables</b> <br>
                Unlike most frozen foods, frozen fruits and vegetables often retain more vitamins and nutrients than fresh ones. These are great to stock up on when
                there's a sale and keep them in your freezer. The trick is to know which ones reheat well and which ones don't. Generally, peas, berries, mushrooms,
                and corn will stay crisp when you heat them up. You can also try freezing bananas when they're just about to go bad so you can save them to make a smoothie later.

                Eggs should be a staple in your fridge. They are a great source of protein, can be made in a variety of ways, and can be eaten by themselves or
                added to a dish. They are also commonly used in baking recipes, so if you want to make a tasty treat for dessert, odds are you'll need eggs.

                There a lot of different flours to choose from, but all-purpose flour will serve your general baking purposes and can also be used for
                thickening sauces or coating foods before frying them. You can also get other types of flour if you are gluten sensitive or need a special
                type of flour, such as when making bread.

                Nuts are good for your heart health and can make a tasty snack by themselves. You can also chop them up and add them as a topping to salads or meat,

                Some type of broth is a must have when it's a cold day or you're feeling under the weather and you want to make soup. Broth is also helpful when you
                need to add moisture or flavor to a dish or to thin out a particularly heavy sauce.
