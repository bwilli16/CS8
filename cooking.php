        <p><b>Ingredients:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>6-12oz salmon filet </li>
            <li>1/4 cup maple syrup </li>
            <li>brown rice </li>
            <li>kale </li>
            <li>1/4 cup water </li>
            <li>1tsp olive oil </li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Begin by preparing rice. While it's cooking, preheat oven to 400 degrees. If the salmon filet is large, cut in half or in thirds.
            Line a baking pan with aluminum foil or parchment paper. Place the salmon on the pan
            and coat with half of the maple syrup. Bake for 15 minutes, then briefly remove to 
            re-coat with the rest of the maple syrup. Bake for an additional 5-10 minutes, depending
            on the thickness of the salmon.
        </p>
        <p>
            Chop desired amount of kale if not already done so. In a pan over medium heat, add water,
            oil, and kale. Cover. Remove cover after a few minutes, sautee until kale is soft. Add salt and pepper to tase.
        </p>
         <p>
            Serve salmon and kale over rice.

        <h2>Chicken Fajita</h2>
        <figure>
            <img alt="Pic of fajita" src="../images/fajita.jpg">
        </figure>
        <p><b>Ingredients:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>2-3 chicken breasts </li>
            <li>1 bell pepper </li>
            <li>1tbsp olive oil </li>
            <li>taco/fajita seasoning mix </li>
            <li>tortillas </li>
            <li>shredded cheese </li>
            <li>lettuce </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Begin by slicing the chicken into small pieces. Place half of the olive oil
            in a pan and heat over medium-high heat. Place the chicken in the pan and sprinkled
            the taco or fajita seasoning over it. Stir occasionally.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cut up a bell pepper and add to the pan after about 5-10 minutes. Add the second half of the
            olive oil. Keep stirring the pan periodically. Cook until chicken is thoroughly cooked, about 20 minutes.
        </p>
         <p>
            Heat up the tortillas in the pan for about a minute per side or microwave for under a minute.
            Add the chicken and peppers to the fajitas, and top with shredded lettuce, cheese, and any additionally
            toppings you may prefer.

       <h2>Ramen in the microwave</h2>
        <figure>
            <img alt="Pic of food" src="../Images/ramen.jpg">

        <p><i>Here's a classic meal every college student needs to know how to make. This is a great one for when you're not feeling well or
           need to eat and study at the same time. If you're at all like me when I got to college, you already know how to make ramen on the 
           stove, but aren't sure how to in the microwave.</i></p>
        <p><b>Ingredients:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Package of ramen noodles (I used the Maruchan Chicken Flavor) </li>
            <li>Two cups of water</li>
            <li><i>Optional</i>: flavor packet that comes in the package</li>
            <li><i>Optional</i>: leftover meat and veggies from your fridge</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Start by filling your microwave-safe bowl with about 2 cups of water. If you have a measuring cup, you can use that, but I usually
            just eyeball the amount. You want enough water in your bowl to both saturate the noodles and serve as broth. Heat up the bowl of water
            for 3 minutes in the microwave to get it good and hot. While the water is heating, use your hands to break up the still-closed package 
            of noodles into smaller blocks so that it cooks faster.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Note: Because the microwave heats the water from all directions (as opposed to just the bottom), it won't boil like it would on the stove.
            Don't worry, the water will still be plenty hot.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
           Open the package of noodles and set aside the flavor packet for later. Add the noodles to the bowl and microwave for about two and a half minutes.
           Open the microwave and stir the noodles, making sure all of them are saturated in the broth. If you have some leftover meat or veggies in your mini
           fridge, now would be a good time to chop those up and add them to your soup. Microwave the soup for another two and a half minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Carefully take the <strong>very hot</strong> bowl out of the microwave with some potholders, oven mitts, washcloths...whatever you've got. If you want
            your soup to be flavored, open the flavor packet and stir in the powder. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Now you have ramen! Grab some crackers to dip in the soup and get back to work (or watch your favorite show on Netflix or Hulu. The choice is yours).
