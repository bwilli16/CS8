        <p><b>Blake</b> is a junior at the University of Vermont, majoring in Data Science and
            Mathematics. He enjoys eating large quantities of (mostly) healthy food, running, playing 
            piano, and sunrise hikes with his homies. You're as likely to find him in the library as
            you are on the track. His favorite food is red curry, assuming that chocolate milk doesn't count.</p>

            reading (both classic and contemporary lit), traveling to new places, and snuggling with her Cocker Spaniel when she's back home in North Carolina.
            When she's not writing papers or cramming for a test, you can find her sipping coffee, knitting, and watching reruns of crime dramas.</p>
