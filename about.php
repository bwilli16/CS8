        <p><b>Blake</b> is a junior at the University of Vermont, majoring in Data Science and
            Mathematics. He enjoys eating large quantities of (mostly) healthy food, running, playing 
            piano, and sunrise hikes with his homies. You're as likely to find him in the library as
            you are on the track. His favorite food is red curry, assuming that chocolate milk doesn't count.</p>

        <p><b>Erin</b>is a freshman at the University of Vermont, majoring in Art Education and minoring in Education for Cultural and
                    Linguistic Diversity. She enjoys creating art, running really slowly, going on fun adventures with friends, and drinking
                    an almost unhealthy amount of tea. If she is not studying, or at least pretending to, you can most likely find her exploring
                    her new home of Burlington, Vermont.</p>

        <p><b>Sarah</b> is a freshman at the University of Vermont, majoring in Political Science and minoring in Public Policy Analysis. She enjoys
            reading (both classic and contemporary lit), traveling to new places, and snuggling with her Cocker Spaniel when she's back home in North Carolina.
            When she's not writing papers or cramming for a test, you can find her sipping coffee, knitting, and watching reruns of crime dramas.</p>
